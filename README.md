# Phil Sloan's Object Oriented Programming SVG LOGO MAKER


  
## Description:
The application allows users to input information through an Inquirer prompt, facilitating the generation of a "logo.svg" file. This file encapsulates the user's specified preferences in the form of an SVG image.

# Overview

## The Challenge:
Develop a Node.js command-line application that receives user inputs for generating an SVG logo, saving it as a "logo.svg" file. Additionally, produce a walkthrough video showcasing the application's functionality and successful execution of all tests.


## User Story
```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```


## Installation
1. Open VScode and begin a new index.js file.
2. In the terminal use "npm install inquirer@6.5.0"
3. Build files and ren tests.


## Usage Instructions

1. Open integrated terminal on index.js
2. Enter “node index.js” in the command line
3. Through sequential order within the command line interface - the user will be presented with npm inquirer questions - the user will provide a response to each question and proceed.
4. Once completed a SVG file named "logo.svg" will be created.
5. As you please, you may rename the "logo.svg" file to the file name of your choice.

## What I Learned
- Developed an application that is not deployed and is triggered by the command "node index.js" in the command line to produce a logo, saving it as an SVG file.
- Acquired proficiency in using the JavaScript testing framework "Jest."
- how to create and use a snapshot.
- How to properly build a walkthrough video and README file.
